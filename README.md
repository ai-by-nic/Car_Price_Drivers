# What Drives the Price of a Used Car? â€” Practical Application 2

This repository contains my analysis for **UC Berkeley ML/AI â€“ Practical Application 2** on usedâ€‘car pricing.  
The goal: **identify the factors that most influence price** and provide dealerâ€‘friendly guidance for stocking and pricing.

## Summary of Findings (dealerâ€‘friendly)

- **Age & mileage dominate.** On average, price changes by about **âˆ’\$720 per additional year** and **âˆ’\$85 per +1,000 miles**.
- **Title & condition matter.** Clean titles and better conditions command clear premiums; **salvage/rebuilt** require steep discounts.
- **Segment effects exist.** Trucks/SUVs and **4WD** often price higher in most markets; adjust to local demand.
- **Complete listings sell better.** Title status, mileage, condition, VIN and clear photos are consistently associated with stronger pricing.

**Quick Pricing Rule of Thumb**  
_Target = Comp âˆ’ ( \$720 Ã— Î”years ) âˆ’ ( \$85 Ã— Î”miles/1,000 ) + TitleAdj + ConditionAdj + FeatureAdj._

## Data & Methods (brief)

- Dataset: public usedâ€‘vehicle listings (subsample of ~100k rows after cleaning/dedup/winsorizing).
- Prep: VIN dedupe, drop nonâ€‘positive prices, winsorize price (1â€“99%), range filters for year/odometer, engineer `car_age`, collapse rare categories, impute + scale + oneâ€‘hot.
- Models compared: **OLS**, **Ridge (L2)**, **Lasso (L1)** with **5â€‘fold crossâ€‘validation**.
- Metric: **MAE** primary; **RMSE** and **RÂ²** reported.

## Model Performance

| Metric   | CV Best (Lasso) | Holdâ€‘out (20%) | Baseline (median price) |
| -------- | --------------: | -------------: | ----------------------: |
| **MAE**  |    â‰ˆ **$5,597** |     **$5,648** |              **$9,824** |
| **RMSE** |               â€” |     **$8,351** |                       â€” |
| **RÂ²**   |               â€” |       **0.58** |                       â€” |

> Note: Lasso had the lowest CV MAE, but the gap to Ridge/OLS was only ~**\$4** (CV SD ~**\$27**) â†’ a **practical tie**. Either model yields similar accuracy; Lasso was selected for its light feature selection.

## How to Use (for dealers)

- **Stocking:** favor **newer, lowâ€‘mile, cleanâ€‘title** vehicles in segments that turn fast locally.
- **Pricing:** start from **local comps**; apply the **age/mileage** adjustments and your house adds/deducts for title/condition/features.
- **Monitor:** check average miss monthly; if it drifts, tune the add/deduct numbers.

See the **Deployment â€” Dealer Oneâ€‘Pager** section inside the notebook for a concise playbook.
